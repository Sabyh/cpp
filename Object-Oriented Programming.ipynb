    "I'll develop a process manager for Linux: A version of a program called Htop. The program will read and publish data about all of the processes on my system. I'll read the data from files, store it into objects, manipulate the objects, and output data to the terminal.\n",

    "## Bjarne on the creation of C++ and classes\n",
    "Bjarne was trying to build a system (a Unix cluster). For that he needed to manipulate hardware, implement memory managers, process schedulers, networking interfaces. He needed to abstract up, where the communication between systems follows a certain protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bjarne looked at what languages were available at the time. C was a good candidate for dealing with low level stuff. It wasn't as popular as it became later, but the support was great since Bjarne was on the same corridor as Brian Kernighan and Dennis Richie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simula, the language that could handle the top stuff was similar and could handle the abstraction, except for it was way too slow - many tens of times too slow. As a result, Bjarne took the class concept from Simula and put it into C."
