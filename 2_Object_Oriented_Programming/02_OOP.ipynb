    "## Bjarne on Inheritance\n",
    "Inheritance was a really hot topic in the 60s, 70s, and 80s, and still very cool in the 90s when Java came along. It's the basic idea that you build on top of something else. The first example of the user inheritance was in some modeling of emergency services in Oslo. You want to read or write a simulation that allows you to estimate where you put your emergency services, e.g. here's a fire station, a police station, etc. For that, you have to build a model of the city with streets, and you have to have vehicles moving on them. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that you build a hierarchy of concepts, starting from the most general and then more and more specialized. E.g. a fire engine is a kind of a truck, which is a kind of a car, which is a kind of a vehicle. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's a way of organizing your data. It's now a lot less popular than it used to be, because it turns out that a lot of our ideas aren't all that hierarchical. "
