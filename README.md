# C++ Cheatsheet
This repo contains material I've covered when learning & reviewing C++.

## C++ in Jupyter Notebooks
Some of the code is written in Jupyter Notebooks. This is possible using `xeus-cling`. 

Here is the [tutorial](https://www.learnopencv.com/xeus-cling-run-c-code-in-jupyter-notebook/) I used to set up the environment.

### In case C++ doesn't show up in the dropdown menu
When I installed `xeus-cling` according to the tutorial above, C++ didn't show up in the drop-down menu when I tried to create a new file. [This solution](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus-cling/issues/217) fixed my issue.
